# loan-prediction-analysis
This project predicts loan eligibility based on applicant data using Python and machine learning techniques.

Programming: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Databricks

# Dataset:
Load Prediction Dataset.csv

# Workflow:
Data Collection – Load and explore the dataset
Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, encode categorical features, feature scaling
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize distributions and correlations
Model Building – Train different ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
Model Evaluation – Compare accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Prediction – Final model for loan eligibility prediction
